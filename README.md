# student-dropout-prediction-model
An AI-powered web app built with Streamlit and Python to predict student dropout risk and provide data-driven insights for academic counseling.

That's an excellent idea. A good README file is essential for any project on GitHub. It explains what your app does, how to use it, and how to run it.

Here is a complete README file for your Streamlit-based student dropout prediction model. You can copy and paste this text directly into your GitHub repository's `README.md` file.

# üéì Student Dropout Prediction and Counseling App

This is a web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the risk of a student dropping out of a university program. The app uses a machine learning model to analyze student data and provides both single-student predictions and a batch analysis with visualizations for multiple students.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Interactive Prediction:** Manually input a student's data to get an instant dropout risk prediction and a personalized counseling message.
  * **Batch Prediction:** Upload a CSV or Excel file containing multiple student records to get predictions for an entire cohort.
  * **Data Visualization:** The app generates informative plots, such as the distribution of dropout risk and grade distributions, to help academic advisors gain insights from their data.
  * **Customizable Interface:** The app features a clean, simple user interface and can be customized with themes and CSS.

## üöÄ How to Run the App Locally

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project uses the following libraries:

  * `streamlit`
  * `pandas`
  * `scikit-learn`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `seaborn`
  * `numpy`

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Train the Model

Before you can run the app, you need to train the machine learning model. This script processes the `dataset.csv` file and saves the trained model as `dropout_model.pkl`.

```bash
python model_training.py
```

### Step 4: Run the Streamlit App

Finally, launch the web application.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab with the app running.

## üìÅ Project Structure

  * `app.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
  * `model_training.py`: Script to train the machine learning model and save it.
  * `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.
  * `dropout_model.pkl`: The trained machine learning model (generated by `model_training.py`).
  * `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python libraries required for the project.

## üìà Model and Data

The model is a `RandomForestClassifier` trained on a diverse set of student features. It predicts the likelihood of a student falling into the "Dropout" category. The training data includes features such as academic performance, social factors, and demographic information.
